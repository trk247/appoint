NPM Versioning Log

-------------
Version 3.0.0
	- Add min and max date
	- Update calendar on props change

	Details
	- Add min and max date
		Disables the day if it's less than minDate or greater than maxDate.
		Also disables next and previous links when appropriate.
	- Update calendar on props change
		This is necessary when you're changing the selectedDate prop of CalenderPicker programmatically.
		For example, in our app after a user selects a date and clicks submit, we reset the form and set the CalendarPicker selectedDate to new Date(). However, the CalendarPicker calendar doesn't actually update.
